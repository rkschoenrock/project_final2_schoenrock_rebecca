## Comments

- I fixed my collapsing margins with relative positioning (on my color-article) after paddings and borders didn't work, but I also had to add relative positioning to the structure-article.
- I couldn't figure out how to make my list of colors responsive to its parent container (color-article) after 500px wide. There was a padding-left of 40px in the normalize CSS and wasn't sure if I could change that.
